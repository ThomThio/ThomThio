### Hello there, welcome to my hacker space ðŸ‘‹

In the day, I wear a Product Manager hat - in the night, I'm an engineer and tinker on tools for personal and (somtimes!) enterprise use.

Im currently plying my trade at Meta in the sales and support workflows. I was a PM at Shopee for an AI Design suite, and 5 years at an enterprise start-up before it was cool ðŸ˜Ž 

In between, I did software engineering at Rakuten in Tokyo, and at a hedge fund. This repo is how I keep up to date with technologies - Ask me anything about products, ads, or financial markets - we'll probably geek out :)
